|--------------|------------|
| Desktop      | ✅ Perfect |

## 🚧 Limitations

- This is a front-end only project — no real user authentication or backend.
- FAQ section is static — no toggle interaction (can be added with JS).

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Effective use of **Flexbox** and **CSS Grid**
- Creating **layered hero sections** with images, text, and overlays
- Designing a layout that adapts to screen size using **media queries**
- Working with **positioning** and **z-index** for video-over-image effects

## ✨ Future Improvements
Add interactivity to FAQ (using JavaScript)

Add animations and transitions
